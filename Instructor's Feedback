SPECIFIC FEEDBACK:
If you plan to upload it to your personal site, 
I suggest separating the slides that contain the code discussion part and the physics part. 
Overall, nothing much to really improve because your outputs were superb!

GENERAL FEEDBACK:
Wow! Extensively explaining everything and making it comprehensive is in itself, going above and beyond. 
You were one of those who really pursue their curiosities during lab class hours 
and it brings me so much joy that you do it with diligence and perseverance. 
You are destined to be a scientist! 
You really set the standard for the 10 points bonus amongst all the reports in the class. 
I can't wait to see how the skills that you learned in this class would materialize into a fully realized thesis. 

Thanks for keeping me on the edge of my seat, 
anticipating what coding explorations are you doing next.

Great great great job, Ron!
